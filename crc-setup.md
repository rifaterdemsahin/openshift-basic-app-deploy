# Setting Up CodeReady Containers (CRC)

Follow these steps to set up CodeReady Containers (CRC) on your local machine for deploying and managing applications on OpenShift.

## 1. Install CRC

### Download CRC
1. **Download the latest version of CRC** from the [official Red Hat CodeReady Containers website](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview).

### Install CRC
2. **Extract the downloaded file** and add the CRC binary to your system's `PATH` so it can be accessed from any command line interface.

## 2. Set Up CRC

Before starting CRC, you can specify the amount of disk space allocated to the CRC virtual machine using the `disk-size` parameter. This can be useful if you anticipate needing more storage space for your OpenShift workloads.

### Set the Disk Size (Optional)

To allocate more storage, configure the disk size (e.g., 100 GB):

```bash
crc config set disk-size 100
```

### Run the Setup Command

After configuring (or if you choose to use the default settings), run the following command to set up CRC:

```bash
crc setup
```

## 3. Start CRC

Start the OpenShift cluster with the following command:

```bash
crc start
```

During the start process, you will be prompted to enter your pull secret, which you can obtain from the same Red Hat OpenShift page where you downloaded CRC.

## 4. Access OpenShift

Once CRC is running, you can access the OpenShift web console by navigating to the URL provided during the CRC start process (usually `https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing`).

Log in using the credentials provided by CRC, typically with the username `kubeadmin` and the password displayed after the CRC start command completes.

This guide now includes the optional step for resizing the CRC disk size before setup, which is crucial for users who require more storage for their OpenShift environment.
